###Ingredients
**curry sauce:**  

* 2 tbsp sunflower oil
* 2 onions, sliced
* 5 garlic cloves, chopped
* 2 medium carrots, sliced
* 4 tsp curry powder
* 600ml chicken stock
* 2 tsp honey
* 4 tsp soy sauce
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp garam masala

**chicken:**

* 4 chicken breast fillets, pounded to 1cm thickness
* salt and pepper for seasoning
* 2 tbsp plain flour
* 1 egg, beaten
* 100g panko breadcrumbs
* vegetable oil for frying

### Method
1. Heat oil in a pan, add onion and garlic and soften. Stir in carrots and cook over low heat for 10-12 minutes.
2. Add flour and curry powder. Gradually stir in stock until combined. Then add honey, soy sauce, and bay leaf. Slowly bring to the boil.
3. Simmer for 20 minutes or until sauce thickens, you want a pouring consistency. Stir in garam masala. Sieve the curry sauce and return to pan on a low heat.
4. Season the chicken. Place flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Coat the chicken in flour, then the egg, and finally the breadcrumbs. Make sure to coat thoroughly.
5. Heat oil in a pan over a medium-high heat. Cook until golden brown.
6. Pour over curry sauce and serve with rice.

We found the recipe relatively straightforward and easy to follow. We think you could even blitz the veg instead of sieving it to minimise waste. To get that iconic Wagamama rice dome, pack the rice into a suitably sized bowl that has been lightly coated with oil. Place a plate on top of it, then turn it all over so the bowl is now upside-down, then remove the bowl slowly (you may have to give it a slight tap).

Overall the meal was delicious however the chicken can be a little greasy. It is definitely worth padding it with kitchen paper to absorb any excess. Having tried the original Wagamama recipe, this is an extremely close recipe. Enjoy!
