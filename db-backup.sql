Then add honey, soy sauce, and bay leaf. Slowly bring to the boil.\r\n3. Simmer for 20 minutes or until sauce thickens, you want a pouring consistency. Stir in garam masala. Sieve the curry sauce and return to pan on a low heat.\r\n4. Season the chicken. Place flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in separate bowls.
