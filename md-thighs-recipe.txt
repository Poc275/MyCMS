# Three Sauce Chicken Thighs
This is an ideal recipe for the post Christmas lull when you need to use up some left over meat. The chilli sauces will also banish those winter blues by providing some much needed heat!

###Ingredients
**chicken:**

* Chicken thighs
* Plain flour
* Salt and pepper

**sauces:**

* 3 tbsp gochujang
* 3 shallots
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 garlic clove
* Thumb sized piece of peeled ginger
* 2 tsp rice wine vinegar
* [Frank's&#174; Buffalo Wings Sauce](http://www.franksredhot.com/products/buffalo-wings-sauce/)
* 1 tbsp honey
* BBQ sauce

### Method
1. Mix salt and pepper in the flour and coat the thighs thoroughly.
2. Place in the oven for 20 mins.
3. Blend the gochujang, shallots, soy, garlic, ginger, and rice wine vinegar for the gochujan sauce.
4. Heat some Frank's hot sauce in a pan and add the honey for the second sauce.
5. Place some BBQ sauce in a bowl for the third sauce.
6. When the chicken is sizzling and brown, coat the thighs with the three sauces using a basting brush.
7. Add back to the oven for 10-12 mins to crisp up.

### Sauce one - Gochujang
[Gochujang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang "Gochujang Wikipedia article") is a Korean red chilli paste, it adds a nice kick to any marinade without being too hot. Although not particularly common here in the UK, it can be found in specialist food outlets, or [online](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daesang-Sunchang-Gochujang-Pepper-500g/dp/B002WTE0MQ "Buy Gochujang at Amazon") (we got ours from a local Chinese supermarket). The taste of Gochujang is very strong, so the other ingredients were added to try and temper the mix.

### Sauce two - Hot Toddy
This sauce takes a popular wing sauce and makes it seasonal by adding some honey. This gives it a nice medicinal feeling which hits the spot at this time of year.

### Sauce three - BBQ
We were that hungry by now that for the third sauce we just used a bottle of readily available BBQ sauce!

Just letting the chicken catch slightly gave the marinades a nice charred taste which added to the flavour. Using thighs with the skin on also added to an overall better taste.
