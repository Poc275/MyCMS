                <h4>Where cooking meets pop culture</h4>
                <p>Brief intro here as to who we are and what we're hoping to achieve. Introduce ourselves with photos.</p>
                <h5>Peter</h5>

                <p>I was, probably like most other people, transfixed by celebrity chef culture. I'd spend hours watching these modern day 
                    Prometheans wave a sharp knife and pan in awe whilst thinking that I couldn't possibly do that. This is simply not true, 
                    if you try you realise that the only reason cookery is held in such high regard is that you haven't really tried doing it. It 
                    is a self-fulfilling prophecy of procrastination so just find something nice that you’d like to eat and start making it now, 
                    right now, do it now, NOW!
                </p>

                <h3>The Music</h3>
                <p>It all starts with a sound. A la Quentin Tarantino when conjuring ideas for films, we use music as an inspiration for our 
                    food. And we listen to <em>anything</em>. From classic American rock inspiring us to make that 
                    <a href="articles/this-is-a-tasty-burger">cornerstone of North American cuisine</a>, to far eastern pop 
                    motivating us to make <a href="articles/bulgogeeee">a Korean infused 
                    sandwich</a>. No kitchen or cooking activity is complete without accompanying music. So listen up, 
                    let the music take you to faraway places, keep those smell receptors open, and with a 
                    pinch of imagination you will be able to taste the ingredients as you listen.
                </p>

                <p>Like countless others, we first heard this song during the final episode of The Sopranos. The 
                    series which had us saying <abbr title="mozzarella">moozadell</abbr> every 5 minutes also 
                    inspired us to make a classic American dish. The image of Tony sitting in the diner, putting 
                    this song on the jukebox, and chowing down, what could be more American than that? Now, 
                    everyone, &ldquo;Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely worrrrld…!&rdquo;
                </p>

                <h3>The Books</h3>
                <p>What do we read between cooking? You'd be surprised to hear that it isn't a lot of cookery books!</p>
                <h4><i class="fa fa-book"></i> A brief history of time - Stephen Hawking</h4>
                <p>We are very interested in science here on Blog Standard Food, to be honest we don't understand how you could not be either. 
                    Learning about nature is to enter a magical world of wonder and amazement, which once started you can never give up. The 
                    universe is a keen area we are interested in, you may have noticed a scattering of quotes on this subject amongst 
                    the articles, so what better way to start than to have one of the greatest minds ever explain the mystery to us. It is a 
                    beautifully written book, we won't lie, some of the subject matter can be tough to understand, but it is more accessible 
                    than you think. For books in a similar vein try Cosmos by Carl Sagan (the great explainer), anything by Brian Cox or 
                    <abbr title="Neil deGrasse Tyson">NDGT</abbr>, or for something a little more entertaining try A Short History of Nearly 
                    Everything by Bill Bryson.
